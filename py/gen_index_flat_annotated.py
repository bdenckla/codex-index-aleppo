"""Generate index-flat-annotated.json from index-flat-corrected.json.

Adds two fields to each page record in the body:

  de_start_whole: True  — the start verse is completely present on this page.
                  False — the start verse is only partially present (the page
                          begins mid-verse).
                  None  — cannot be determined from available evidence.

  de_end_whole:   True  — the end verse is completely present on this page.
                  False — the end verse is only partially present (the page
                          ends mid-verse).
                  None  — cannot be determined from available evidence.

Inference rules
---------------
For **non-gap boundaries** the wholeness is inferred from adjacent records:

  * A page's *end* verse is partial if the next page's *start* verse is the
    same triple [book, ch, v] and no gap intervenes.  Otherwise it is whole.
  * A page's *start* verse is partial if the previous page's *end* verse is
    the same triple and no gap intervenes.  Otherwise it is whole.

For **gap-boundary verses** (start verse after a "Before" gap, end verse
before an "After" gap) the wholeness is resolved from the gh-pages/ directory,
which records the exact Hebrew words at which each missing section begins and
ends.  The resolved values are encoded in _GAP_WHOLENESS below.

Usage
-----
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/gen_index_flat_annotated.py [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

Defaults:
    INPUT  = aleppo-wiki/index-flat-corrected.json
    OUTPUT = index-flat-annotated.json

Both defaults were wrong until 2026-08-22, and in two different ways.  The Usage
block named ``../codex-index/aleppo/`` for each -- a sibling repo whose ``aleppo/``
directory became this repo's ``aleppo-wiki/`` in ``9025037`` (2026-03-28).  Of the
two, only DEFAULT_INPUT was really spelled that way in the code, so the input was as
dead as the four literals in ``aleppo-wiki/main_make_wikisource_page.py``, dead the
same way and since the same day.  DEFAULT_OUTPUT was already this repo's root, so
there the Usage block was simply describing something the code did not do.
